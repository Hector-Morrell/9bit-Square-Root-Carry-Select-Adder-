# 9bit-Square-Root-Carry-Select-Adder-

This is an implementation of a 9-bit Square Root Carry Select Adder. For this project I designed the schematic of the 1 bit Full Adder in Cadence. 
From here I did the testing portion as well using the ADE L tool on Cadence to get the transient response of the circuit and ensure it was functioning correctly. 
I also ran DC operating points on the circuit to get the current flow from the input voltage source, to find Energy and power. From here I also designed the
layout of the circuit in Layout XL on Cadence. The used the functional 1-Bit to make a cascading 9-bit. Successfully Performed DRC, LVS and QRC on the design of 9 
bit square root Carry Select Adder in cadence Virtuoso to find the violations in the design. Successfully performed checks on all the constraints 
such as delay and Power consumption.
